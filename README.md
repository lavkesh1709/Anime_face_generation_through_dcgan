# Anime_face_generation_through_dcgan

This project focuses on generating anime faces using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN). DCGANs are a class of GANs that use convolutional and convolutional-transpose layers to generate high-quality images. The primary goal of this project is to create a model that can generate new, realistic anime faces after being trained on a dataset of existing anime faces.

Key Features
Dataset: Collection of anime faces used for training the GAN model.
DCGAN Architecture: Utilizes deep convolutional layers to improve the quality and stability of generated images.
Training Process: Implementation of the training loop for the DCGAN, including loss functions for both the generator and discriminator.
Generated Results: Examples of anime faces generated by the trained model.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anime-face-generation-dcgan.git
cd anime-face-generation-dcgan
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare the Dataset:

Download the anime faces dataset and place it in the specified directory.
Train the Model:

Run the Jupyter Notebook Anime_face_generation_through_dcgan.ipynb to start training the DCGAN model.
Generate Anime Faces:

Use the trained model to generate new anime faces by executing the relevant cells in the notebook.
Results
The trained DCGAN model can generate high-quality anime faces. Examples of generated images are provided in the notebook, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model.
